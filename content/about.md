Hey there, I'm the founder of Self Taught Coder, where I share the [specific knowledge](https://nav.al/specific-knowledge) I've learned while improving my skills as a software engineer without a formal CS background.

I'm a software engineer at Honey (acquired by PayPal) where I work on the core backend team responsible for the architecture and development of Honey's data platform.

Feedback is always welcome.

Thanks!
